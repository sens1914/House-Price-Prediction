## Use linear regression to predict house price from size. Draw epoch vs accuracy graph. Also draw epoch vs loss/error graph.

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow/Keras to predict house prices based on the living area size (GrLivArea). The dataset is loaded and preprocessed using Pandas and NumPy, then normalized for better training. A single-neuron model (equivalent to linear regression) is trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function. 

Training performance is visualized through Matplotlib plots showing how the model’s loss and error change across epochs for both training and validation data.
