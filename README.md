## Use linear regression to predict house price from size. Draw epoch vs accuracy graph. Also draw epoch vs loss/error graph.

This project predicts house prices based on house size (living area) using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed, cleaned, and visualized before training a neural network model. The model takes the square footage (GrLivArea) as input and outputs the predicted SalePrice.

The project also includes data visualization for understanding the distribution of prices and tracking training performance across epochs.

## Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

NumPy & Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Train-test split & feature scaling

TensorFlow / Keras – Neural network model building and training
